How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I am using Windows and I use "FC" command

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    use Git, a version control system

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: I can have more control over the files history
    con: more troublesome

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is more efficient

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    no idea

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I could always revert back to older file

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to do version control :)
