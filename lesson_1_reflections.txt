How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I am using Windows and I use "FC" command


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could let me experiment my code, and easily revert back to working
    version in the past and make comparison to inspect what goes wrong.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: I can have more control over the files history
    con: more troublesome as it introduce more works


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is more efficient to save multiple files in one commit


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: I could inspect the past ID with brief description of the changes,
      and quickly checkout the older version
    git diff: I could compare two commits to view the differences.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I could always revert back to older file with version control, as well as
    creating new branch and do some experiment in my codes


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    The first thing I may do is to upload my current working program into GitHub
    once I complete the course, and start to experiment different code
    implementation with the power of version control
