When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to collaborate with others, or I want to turn my codes into
    open source

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I may want to continue working on my local files without being combined with
    new changes from GitHub latest file

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: copy GitHub repository of others to your own GitHub repository
    Clones: copy from GitHub or local repository, to your local repository
    Branches: make a commit with locally with other branch name

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you are in rush, you can copy remote file and slowly deal with conflict
    code until you resolve all the conflict between origin/master and master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I will use email without Git or GitHub, and it will be harder to keep 
    track of different files if I have multiple projects going on parallelly.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I want to let other teammate to review the changes before applying
    to master branch.
